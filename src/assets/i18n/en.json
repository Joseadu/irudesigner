Design has always been part of my life: growing up in a print shop surrounded by color swatches, the smell of ink, and stacks of paper… I had no other option. While trying to decode the secrets behind communication effectively through images, I decided to study audiovisuals and photography, and in this path I discovered that graphic design is my passion.\n\nEveryone said “Everything is design”. Discovering the reasons behind an effective and visual interesting design, became my new mission/obsession.",

Its core mission is to enable investors, businesses and consumers to make informed decisions that contribute to a more sustainable future. The platform covers more than 70,000 companies, 430,000 funds and 400 national and sub-national governments, offering reliable data and methodologies grounded in scientific evidence.",

      },
      "CONTEXT": "Context",
      "WHEN_I_JOINED": "When I joined Clarity AI, I realised that the brand lacked visual and narrative consistency, which limited its ability to evolve alongside the business. Without clear brand guidelines, visual output was inconsistent, and the tone of communication unintentionally positioned the company as an environmental NGO rather than a technology leader. To maximise impact, I defined three strategic priorities: a full brand refresh, improved data visualisation and a better user experience across the corporate website and the product.",
      "THE_VISUAL_ELEMENTS": "Visual assets were scarce and limited to watercolour illustrations, which gave the brand an unintentionally naive appearance.",
      "REBRANDING_STRATEGY": "Brand refresh strategy",
      "I_REDESIGNED": "I redesigned Clarity AI's visual identity to reflect its innovative vision and support its growth in the market. The result was a more modern and accessible visual universe (WCAG compliant), documented in a practical style guide that allowed the entire team to apply the brand consistently. To reinforce coherence and speed up production, I created templates, standardised visual assets and developed a shared library of icons and illustrations. This streamlined content creation and boosted brand recognition both internally and externally.",
      "I_DEVELOPED_GRAPHIC_STYLE": "I also introduced a new illustration style based on the brand's primary colour, using abstract compositions to communicate key ideas. This illustration bank is now used across social media, the website and internal presentations. In addition, I curated a system of filtered stock photography, creating another layer of brand identification.",
      "AS_PART_OF_REBRANDING": "As part of the rebrand, it became clear that the logotype required structural changes. It became difficult to read when scaled down, especially when placed alongside competitors' logos or printed in small formats. Since the brand wanted to keep the original concept, I refined the spacing and character shapes to improve legibility and performance at small sizes. For this reason, both versions of the logo appear throughout the project documentation.",
      "DATA_VISUALIZATION": "Data visualisation",
      "DATA_VISUALIZATION_DESCRIPTION": "Although Clarity AI is a company driven by data and research, there was no solid approach to data visualisation. This made insights harder to communicate, particularly for non-technical audiences. One of my main challenges was to redesign the way data was presented across formats and platforms, making it clearer, more engaging and easier to understand.",
      "I_IDENTIFIED_STUDIES": "Internal studies were perceived as technical and dense. My goal was to turn complexity into clarity. Through training workshops, I introduced new storytelling standards for teams working with clients, designed more appealing and interactive visualisations for the blog, and completely renewed print and digital research reports. As a result, information shifted from being a barrier to becoming a persuasive communication tool.",
      "CLARITY_PLATFORM_DATAVIZ": "The Clarity AI platform included multiple, highly complex data modules, but lacked a unified system to ensure consistency and accessibility. Working closely with the UI/UX team, I designed a visualisation framework integrated into the Design System. This allowed teams to add new charts more easily, guaranteed accessibility and reduced development time by 50%, ensuring faster and more efficient implementation. The visualisations shown on the right form part of this Design System.",
      "UX_IMPROVEMENT": "User experience (UX) improvement",
      "UX_IMPROVEMENT_DESCRIPTION": "As a visual designer at Clarity AI Design Product Team, I led the optimisation of both the corporate website and the data platform to enhance user experience, accessibility and conversion. With a data-driven approach and user-centred principles, I carried out a deep analysis of the user journey using heatmaps, confetti maps, scroll-maps and overlay reports. This allowed us to identify pain points in navigation and redesign the interface to align with the new brand identity, reduce conversion bottlenecks and increase both form submissions and traffic to the blog — an area that required high investment from the company.",
      "BLOG_ISSUES": {
        "TITLE": "Issues Identified in the Blog and Navigation",
        "TABS_CONFUSING": "Some main issues included the presence of a long, confusing tab (Research & Insights) with no visual alignment with the rest of the site;",
        "CLICK_RATE": "A low click-rate on the primary CTA \"Request a Demo\";",
        "FILTER_INCOHERENCE": "Incoherent filtering options, offering only a single thematic filter despite broader options in the main menu, and no filtering at all on mobile;",
        "INFINITE_SCROLL": "And infinite scrolling, which prevented users from reaching the bottom of the page or knowing how many results were available."
      },
      "BLOG_SOLUTIONS": {
        "TITLE": "Solutions Implemented",
        "MENU_REORGANIZATION": "I reorganised the main navigation menu to improve accessibility and create a more intuitive browsing experience.",
        "CTA_REDESIGN": "The main UX writing CTA was redesigned — both visually and verbally — to make it more compelling.",
        "SEARCH_BAR": "A keyword search bar was added, and filtering options were harmonised by including format and topic, with the possibility of selecting multiple filters simultaneously for a far more personalised experience.",
        "SORT_RESULTS": "I introduced the option to sort results by date or popularity",
        "PAGINATION": "Replaced infinite scroll with pagination, giving users full control over the content.",
        "BLOG_REDESIGN": "I also redesigned the entire blog template."
      },
      "TOGETHER_WITH_UIUX": "Together with the UI/UX team, I rethought the waiting experience in the report-generation process. What was previously a moment of frustration became a moment of value: a clear progress bar and a small informative animation kept users informed and reassured, reinforcing the perception of efficiency and trust in the platform."

        "DESCRIPTION": "Visual identity, graphic design, motion graphics and UI/UX design"
      },
      "DESCRIPTION": "Tooting Police Station is a former police building acquired by Telereal Trillium with the intention of transforming it into a residential development with shared community spaces, while preserving its historic structure and architectural character. At Concilio Communications, we created a contemporary visual identity tailored to the local audience, helping connect all consultation materials and build a sense of familiarity and trust with the residents of Tooting, London.",
      "CONTEXT": "Context",
      "CONTEXT_DESCRIPTION": "Our research into the area revealed a young community with a strong emotional connection to local heritage, combined with a widespread feeling that landmarks such as the police station had been neglected over the years. This presented a clear opportunity. Rather than treating the building as a relic of the past, we could use design to celebrate its history in a fresh and approachable way, encouraging residents to participate in the consultation process.",
      "CONCEPT_STRATEGY": "Concept and strategy",
      "CONCEPT_STRATEGY_DESCRIPTION": "We determined that the project needed a contemporary identity that felt relevant to a younger audience without losing its historic soul. A monochromatic palette offered simplicity and clear visual impact. The symbol was created using the building’s distinctive silhouette, which we were able to study in detail through drone imagery. Translating its outline into a graphic mark gave the brand a strong sense of place and immediate recognisability. To balance the length of the project name and strengthen the personality of the logo, the letters M, N and A were customised in line with the shape of the symbol. A flexible and eye-catching pattern was also developed to support both print and digital applications, helping the visual identity feel cohesive across all materials.",
      "FINAL_RESULT": "Final result",
      "FINAL_RESULT_DESCRIPTION": "The branding was very positively received by the local community. The visual identity improved recognition of the project across the neighbourhood and helped increase participation in public consultations by 40% compared with previous initiatives. The designed materials sparked positive feedback on social media and local forums, where residents highlighted the emotional link between the graphic proposal and the history of the building. Ultimately, the brand positioned the development as a modern and inclusive initiative that respected collective memory while engaging directly with the residents of Tooting, London."

      "DESCRIPTION": "Concilio is a London-based communications consultancy specialising in the construction and property sector. The company acts as a bridge between developers and local communities, facilitating the statutory public consultations required for new urban developments. Through in-person events and online engagement, residents are able to share concerns, ask questions and influence decision-making, ensuring that regeneration projects are delivered in a more human, sustainable and participatory way.",
      "CONTEXT": "Context",
      "CONTEXT_DESCRIPTION": "After several months working within the company, it became clear that the existing visual system (rigid and slightly outdated) no longer reflected the organisation’s growth or evolving communication needs. Working closely with the leadership team, we rethought the brand structure to allow Concilio to expand its services without losing clarity or recognition. The result was a new three-part architecture: Concilio Consult, focused on public consultation and community engagement; Concilio Connect, dedicated to digital communication; and Concilio Create, a design studio specialising in branding, print and digital environments, which I had the opportunity to lead from its launch for two years.",
      "CONCEPT_STRATEGY": "Concept and Strategy",
      "CONCEPT_STRATEGY_DESCRIPTION": "To distinguish these three areas while maintaining a unified brand, I proposed a system of sub-brands. Concilio enjoys high recognition within the sector, so it was strategically important not to stray too far from the existing logotype. Radically redesigning it risked creating confusion or giving the impression of a new, unrelated company. Instead, we retained the original structure of the logo and added the service identifier in the same typeface, creating a clear, consistent and scalable system that supported future growth.",
      "FINAL_RESULT": "Outcome",
      "FINAL_RESULT_DESCRIPTION": "The introduction of Concilio Create and Concilio Connect led to a significant increase in project volume. Clients valued the ability to access an end-to-end service: from stakeholder engagement and community consultation, to website design and full visual identity development for each project. This integrated approach streamlined processes, saved time, and gave clients a competitive advantage, presenting their developments with a more professional, coherent and impactful image.

The site was renamed Dagenham Green, with plans to deliver more than 3,500 new homes, including 1,550 affordable units, as well as a secondary school, local shops, restaurants and a public park featuring native vegetation.",
      "INTUITION_AND_RESOLVE": "Intuition and Resolve",
      "INTUITION_AND_RESOLVE_DESCRIPTION": "This was one of the first projects I led with Concilio Create, and the main challenge was not only designing the consultation materials, but redefining how we worked as a team. Drawing inspiration from Design Thinking methodologies, I proposed a more collaborative workflow from the earliest stages. All key stakeholders were involved in shaping the concept: Peabody as client, dn&co as the branding agency, Concilio Consult’s internal team and representatives from the Greater London Authority. This shared decision-making, combined with early validation rounds, helped us avoid endless revisions and last-minute surprises, ensuring that the final outcome matched the client’s expectations and the needs of the community.",
      "COLLABORATE_WITH_PURPOSE": "Collaborate with Purpose",
      "COLLABORATE_WITH_PURPOSE_DESCRIPTION": "My main contribution focused on the design of the website and a wide range of printed materials, including signage and public information leaflets. Using dn&co’s visual guidelines as a foundation, I adapted the brand into an accessible, intuitive and cohesive experience. The audience for this project was incredibly diverse in age, background and digital literacy, so accessibility played a central role. The aim was to deliver clarity without losing the bold and colourful spirit of the brand. My previous experience working with public institutions, and particularly with Peabody, helped anticipate technical challenges and deliver on tight deadlines. My background in large-format print also ensured that all materials translated effectively from screen to physical environments.",
      "PRIDE_AND_MEMORY": "Pride and memory",
      "PRIDE_AND_MEMORY_DESCRIPTION": "Thanks to the new collaborative workflow, the design process started with active listening and a real understanding of the site’s cultural context. Conversations with residents highlighted the historical significance of the land: its industrial roots along the Thames, the iconic Ford factory that produced more than 10 million cars since 1931, and, most importantly, its place in the history of labour rights and women’s equality following the 1968 sewing machinists’ strike. Embedding this legacy into the visual design gave the project depth and authenticity. It allowed us to create a narrative rooted in community pride and collective memory, not just a new neighbourhood, but the next chapter of a place with a powerful past."

      "DESCRIPTION": "Barkers of Kensington is a historic London landmark currently undergoing a full refurbishment to meet modern sustainability standards, while preserving its architectural and cultural value. The building will primarily house spacious, light-filled offices, and its large roof terrace overlooking Kensington is set to become one of its most striking features. To create an open conversation with local residents throughout the process, Concilio organised a series of community engagement events, which required a distinct visual identity for the project.",
      "STORIES_THAT_LEAD": "Stories that Lead",
      "STORIES_THAT_LEAD_DESCRIPTION": "This was one of the most emblematic projects developed by Concilio Create. Barkers is a building with deep emotional resonance in the neighbourhood and a strong architectural presence in the city. Its symbolic weight meant that the visual identity had to feel respectful, sophisticated and firmly grounded in the history of the site. Any branding proposal needed to match both the grandeur of the building and the expectations of a community that views it as part of its collective memory.",
      "GOOD_DESIGN": "Good Design Makes a Difference",
      "GOOD_DESIGN_DESCRIPTION": "The final identity balanced classical visual references — paying tribute to the building’s heritage — with a contemporary and functional graphic approach. This allowed the brand to communicate elegance and seriousness without feeling outdated. The visual language was applied consistently across printed and digital materials, creating a unified presence throughout the consultation process. As part of a broader end-to-end service that included community communication and web development, the identity contributed to a strong and coherent narrative for the project. Clients highlighted the positive shift in perception, noting a more structured, professional and trustworthy image."

      "UNSTOPPABLE_IDEA_DESCRIPTION": "What began as a short-term institutional campaign across the province quickly became an ongoing project due to its positive impact. The main objective was to make women visible in sport, normalise their presence, celebrate their achievements and promote genuine equality without falling into clichés or stereotypes. During the three years I was part of the team, more than twenty activities and sponsorships were carried out, including the +deporte +mujer Week, with daily actions such as guided hikes led by women ambassadors and walking events for older participants.",
      "KEY_CHALLENGES": "Key Challenges",
      "KEY_CHALLENGES_DESCRIPTION": "The main challenge was to create a visual identity that broke away from a traditional institutional tone. The campaign needed to feel friendly, energetic and adaptable to a wide range of physical and digital formats. As the lead designer for print applications, I developed a versatile graphic system centred around a handwritten, energetic logotype designed to convey movement and vitality. We selected vibrant, almost neon colours against a black background to ensure strong contrast and high visibility. The idea was for participants to feel that the campaign spoke to them directly, rather than as something distant or imposed.<br><br>One of the most important challenges was translating the brand into physical space. Traditional materials such as roll-ups proved impractical for outdoor activities, so I designed a lightweight circular display, affectionately nicknamed the cookie, that was easy to transport and highly visible. It quickly became a recognisable feature of the campaign, especially at open-air events.",

      "FAITH_ARCHITECTURE_DESCRIPTION": "The triangle became the central structure of the poster. It is one of the most fundamental forms in architecture, associated with balance, strength and structural integrity. Beyond its geometric function, it evokes the stained-glass compositions found in churches and cathedrals, where light becomes colour and meaning. The triangle also carries a deeply rooted Christian symbolism: its three sides traditionally represent the Holy Trinity — Father, Son and Holy Spirit — the core pillar of Christian belief. This connection between form and meaning helped anchor the visual narrative in a language instantly recognisable, even in a contemporary setting.",
      "SACRED_REINTERPRETATIONS": "Reinterpreting the Sacred",
      "SACRED_REINTERPRETATIONS_DESCRIPTION": "With the concept of Via Crucis in mind — a devotional practice that retraces the Passion of Christ — choosing a medieval-inspired typeface felt natural. The blackletter script references sacred manuscripts and religious iconography, yet its modern treatment prevents it from feeling nostalgic or ornamental. The deer introduces a symbolic counterpoint. Historically linked to pagan mythology, it stands at the intersection of the sacred and the earthly. This tension allows the poster to acknowledge religious heritage while inviting new interpretations, where spirituality exists outside of strict doctrine. The result is a visual proposal that neither rejects nor idealises the sacred. Instead, it reframes it — blending tradition and contemporaneity to reveal how symbolism evolves, adapts and remains culturally alive."

      "CARD": {
        "TITLE": "RESTAURANTE YAKI",
        "DESCRIPTION": "Branding, Graphic Design, Packaging, Illustration, Digital Design and Merchandising"
      },
      "DESCRIPTION": "Yaki is not a typical Japanese restaurant. It is an izakaya — an urban tavern centred on street-food cooked on the grill (yaki), which gives the venue its name. The idea was to open a fresh, distinctive space in the centre of Málaga, offering something different from the traditional Japanese dining scene. The short, bold name reinforces that position: easy to remember, direct, and far removed from the classic imagery of sushi, kanji symbols and solemnity. The goal was to connect with a new generation of Japan enthusiasts.",
      "VIBRANT_VISUAL_UNIVERSE": "A Vibrant Visual Universe",
      "VIBRANT_VISUAL_UNIVERSE_DESCRIPTION": "The visual identity deliberately breaks away from minimalist Japanese clichés — no bamboo, no quiet red-and-white palette. Instead, the system embraces a bold neon-inspired aesthetic, saturated colours and playful patterns that reference both tradition and 1990s anime. Pop-culture characters like Pikachu or Naruto sit next to onis, ramen bowls and graphic nods to folklore, creating a recognisable and flexible brand world. The result is a lively, humorous identity that builds an emotional connection with a young, fandom-driven audience.",
      "MORE_THAN_A_RESTAURANT": "More than a Restaurant",
      "MORE_THAN_A_RESTAURANT_DESCRIPTION": "Since opening, Yaki has become more than a spot for fans of the umami. It is steadily turning into a meeting place for Málaga’s otaku community. Participation has been key: customers vote on new characters, illustrators are invited to competitions, and cultural activities such as exhibitions, cosplay contests and mini manga fairs are held in-house. Yaki is positioning itself as a cultural hub, not just a food destination.",
      "MILLENNIAL_NOSTALGIA": "Millennial Nostalgia, Packaged",
      "MILLENNIAL_NOSTALGIA_DESCRIPTION": "The packaging continues the energy of the visual identity, with characters inspired by millennial childhood memories reimagined through a modern, colourful graphic lens. Every box, cup and napkin becomes part of the brand universe, using neon tones, expressive illustration and Japanese lettering treated in a playful, contemporary way. The logotype adapts to each format, becoming an organic element of the packaging itself, turning the unwrapping moment into part of the experience."

        "TITLE": "HOTEL TEATRO ALAMEDA MÁLAGA",
        "DESCRIPTION": "Branding"
      },
      "DESCRIPTION": "Antonio Banderas will finally have his own theatre in Málaga: Teatro Alameda. The project blends a modern boutique hotel with classic theatre spaces under the same roof. The ambition is clear to create one of the city’s cultural landmarks, offering a unique mix of performance, contemporary design and comfort. Located in the heart of Soho, just a few minutes from Málaga’s historic centre, the building is set to become an iconic presence in the neighbourhood.",
      "LOGO_CONCEPT": "Logo Concept",
      "LOGO_CONCEPT_DESCRIPTION": "The interior design team developed a strong conceptual foundation for the project, giving the hotel and theatre a contemporary boho aesthetic. With that as a starting point, the brand identity uses warm tones and a visual language inspired by bohemian elements such as feathers and arrows. The arrow plays a particularly symbolic role. It represents the meeting point between artists and the city, a space where creativity and local culture come together. Visually, when rotated, the arrow also resembles quotation marks, a subtle reference to spoken lines, storytelling and the voice of the characters on stage.",
      "HOME_OF_DREAMS": "“Home of Dreams”",
      "HOME_OF_DREAMS_DESCRIPTION": "The tagline works both as a descriptor and an emotional message: Home of Dreams. Málaga’s cultural scene is increasingly international, so using English felt natural and effective. The word Home evokes comfort, hospitality and the atmosphere of the hotel, while Dreams speaks directly to the world of theatre — stories, imagination and creativity. Together, they summarise the dual personality of the space: a place to rest, and a place to dream.",
      "HOTEL_SUBBRAND": "Hotel Sub-brand",
      "HOTEL_SUBBRAND_DESCRIPTION": "Within the visual system, the Alameda symbol is framed inside a green square diamond. The diamond conveys stability and security, aligning with the experience expected in the hotel rooms. The colour green reinforces that sense of calm, balance and reassurance. To expand the visual language and ensure consistency across a large number of materials, we developed a system of decorative motifs. Each shape is linked to a function: the green diamond identifies everything related to the hotel, while the pink circle represents the theatre.",
      "THEATRE_SUBBRAND": "Theatre Sub-brand",
      "THEATRE_SUBBRAND_DESCRIPTION": "For the theatre, we chose the circle. Traditional proscenium stages are semicircular in shape, but Teatro Alameda will also host contemporary and experimental performances, not only classical theatre. The circular motif therefore speaks both to tradition and to artistic exploration. The decorative patterns can be combined or repeated in many ways, introducing movement and dynamism to posters, brochures, signage and digital pieces.",
      "COHERENT_VISUAL_SYSTEM": "A Coherent Visual System",
      "COHERENT_VISUAL_SYSTEM_DESCRIPTION": "The same visual structure is used across the entire building’s signage. Framed within circles and diamonds, each space is identified according to its function, maintaining a unified visual language throughout the hotel and theatre areas.<br><br>For internal signage, we kept the same visual grammar, but applied the corporate orange and black to maximise contrast and legibility, essential in a space that mixes public areas, bedrooms, performance rooms and exhibition zones."

        "DESCRIPTION": "Branding and Graphic Design"
      },
      "DESCRIPTION": "Weekend Festival, held in Helsinki and Espoo, brings together more than forty thousand electronic music fans every year, featuring world-class artists such as Steve Aoki and Evelina. One of its trademarks is visual reinvention. Each edition adopts a completely new theme, turning the festival into an immersive experience where music, staging and design evolve together. This constant transformation has made it one of the most anticipated events in Northern Europe, where creativity plays as central a role as the line-up itself.",
      "NEW_EDITION": "New Edition, New Identity",
      "NEW_EDITION_DESCRIPTION": "Imagine standing beneath thousands of lights, lasers and pyrotechnics at the iconic Weekend Stage, or losing yourself in pure techno at the intimate CNNCT Stage. Every edition delivers high production value and powerful visual storytelling. For this year’s concept, the identity focused entirely on the colours of the rainbow. It was not a decorative gesture or a seasonal trend, but a clear and intentional statement of support for the LGTBIQ+ community. The festival wanted the brand to feel inclusive, proud and unapologetically vibrant.",
      "GRAPHIC_LANGUAGE": "A Graphic Language Built to Electrify",
      "GRAPHIC_LANGUAGE_DESCRIPTION": "Drawing inspiration from the origins of electronic music in the 1980s, the visual system was built using abstract shapes with grainy, atmospheric textures that evoke mystery, movement and energy. When combined with intensely saturated rainbow tones on deep black backgrounds, these compositions create a visual rhythm that mirrors the pulse of the festival itself. The result is a digital-first identity that feels bold, recognisable and constantly in motion. Every format, from screens to social media to stage graphics, becomes part of the same electric world, amplifying the festival experience long before the first beat drops."
