    "ABOUT_ME": "Hi! My name is Irene, and I’m a senior graphic designer specialized in branding. Design has always been part of my life: growing up in a print shop surrounded by color swatches, the smell of ink, and stacks of paper… I had no other option. While trying to decode the secrets behind communication effectively through images, I decided to study audiovisuals and photography, and in this path I discovered that graphic design is my passion.\n\nEveryone said “Everything is design”. Discovering the reasons behind an effective and visual interesting design, became my new mission/obsession.",

      },
      "CONTEXT": "Context",
      "WHEN_I_JOINED": "When I joined Clarity AI, I realised that the brand lacked visual and narrative consistency, which limited its ability to evolve alongside the business. Without clear brand guidelines, visual output was inconsistent, and the tone of communication unintentionally positioned the company as an environmental NGO rather than a technology leader. To maximise impact, I defined three strategic priorities: a full brand refresh, improved data visualisation and a better user experience across the corporate website and the product.",
      "THE_VISUAL_ELEMENTS": "Visual assets were scarce and limited to watercolour illustrations, which gave the brand an unintentionally naive appearance.",
      "REBRANDING_STRATEGY": "Brand refresh strategy",
      "I_REDESIGNED": "I redesigned Clarity AI's visual identity to reflect its innovative vision and support its growth in the market. The result was a more modern and accessible visual universe (WCAG compliant), documented in a practical style guide that allowed the entire team to apply the brand consistently. To reinforce coherence and speed up production, I created templates, standardised visual assets and developed a shared library of icons and illustrations. This streamlined content creation and boosted brand recognition both internally and externally.",
      "I_DEVELOPED_GRAPHIC_STYLE": "I also introduced a new illustration style based on the brand's primary colour, using abstract compositions to communicate key ideas. This illustration bank is now used across social media, the website and internal presentations. In addition, I curated a system of filtered stock photography, creating another layer of brand identification.",
      "AS_PART_OF_REBRANDING": "As part of the rebrand, it became clear that the logotype required structural changes. It became difficult to read when scaled down, especially when placed alongside competitors' logos or printed in small formats. Since the brand wanted to keep the original concept, I refined the spacing and character shapes to improve legibility and performance at small sizes. For this reason, both versions of the logo appear throughout the project documentation.",
      "DATA_VISUALIZATION": "Data visualisation",
      "DATA_VISUALIZATION_DESCRIPTION": "Although Clarity AI is a company driven by data and research, there was no solid approach to data visualisation. This made insights harder to communicate, particularly for non-technical audiences. One of my main challenges was to redesign the way data was presented across formats and platforms, making it clearer, more engaging and easier to understand.",
      "I_IDENTIFIED_STUDIES": "Internal studies were perceived as technical and dense. My goal was to turn complexity into clarity. Through training workshops, I introduced new storytelling standards for teams working with clients, designed more appealing and interactive visualisations for the blog, and completely renewed print and digital research reports. As a result, information shifted from being a barrier to becoming a persuasive communication tool.",
      "CLARITY_PLATFORM_DATAVIZ": "The Clarity AI platform included multiple, highly complex data modules, but lacked a unified system to ensure consistency and accessibility. Working closely with the UI/UX team, I designed a visualisation framework integrated into the Design System. This allowed teams to add new charts more easily, guaranteed accessibility and reduced development time by 50%, ensuring faster and more efficient implementation. The visualisations shown on the right form part of this Design System.",
      "UX_IMPROVEMENT": "User experience (UX) improvement",
      "UX_IMPROVEMENT_DESCRIPTION": "As a visual designer at Clarity AI Design Product Team, I led the optimisation of both the corporate website and the data platform to enhance user experience, accessibility and conversion. With a data-driven approach and user-centred principles, I carried out a deep analysis of the user journey using heatmaps, confetti maps, scroll-maps and overlay reports. This allowed us to identify pain points in navigation and redesign the interface to align with the new brand identity, reduce conversion bottlenecks and increase both form submissions and traffic to the blog — an area that required high investment from the company.",
      "BLOG_ISSUES": {
        "TITLE": "Issues Identified in the Blog and Navigation",
        "TABS_CONFUSING": "Some main issues included the presence of a long, confusing tab (Research & Insights) with no visual alignment with the rest of the site;",
        "CLICK_RATE": "A low click-rate on the primary CTA \"Request a Demo\";",
        "FILTER_INCOHERENCE": "Incoherent filtering options, offering only a single thematic filter despite broader options in the main menu, and no filtering at all on mobile;",
        "INFINITE_SCROLL": "And infinite scrolling, which prevented users from reaching the bottom of the page or knowing how many results were available."
      },
      "BLOG_SOLUTIONS": {
        "TITLE": "Solutions Implemented",
        "MENU_REORGANIZATION": "I reorganised the main navigation menu to improve accessibility and create a more intuitive browsing experience.",
        "CTA_REDESIGN": "The main UX writing CTA was redesigned — both visually and verbally — to make it more compelling.",
        "SEARCH_BAR": "A keyword search bar was added, and filtering options were harmonised by including format and topic, with the possibility of selecting multiple filters simultaneously for a far more personalised experience.",
        "SORT_RESULTS": "I introduced the option to sort results by date or popularity",
        "PAGINATION": "Replaced infinite scroll with pagination, giving users full control over the content.",
        "BLOG_REDESIGN": "I also redesigned the entire blog template."
      },
      "TOGETHER_WITH_UIUX": "Together with the UI/UX team, I rethought the waiting experience in the report-generation process. What was previously a moment of frustration became a moment of value: a clear progress bar and a small informative animation kept users informed and reassured, reinforcing the perception of efficiency and trust in the platform."

        "TITLE": "FORMER TOOTING POLICE STATION",
        "DESCRIPTION": "Visual identity, graphic design, motion graphics and UI/UX design"
      },
      "DESCRIPTION": "Tooting Police Station is a former police building acquired by Telereal Trillium with the intention of transforming it into a residential development with shared community spaces, while preserving its historic structure and architectural character. At Concilio Communications, we created a contemporary visual identity tailored to the local audience, helping connect all consultation materials and build a sense of familiarity and trust with the residents of Tooting, London.",
      "CONTEXT": "Context",
      "CONTEXT_DESCRIPTION": "Our research into the area revealed a young community with a strong emotional connection to local heritage, combined with a widespread feeling that landmarks such as the police station had been neglected over the years. This presented a clear opportunity. Rather than treating the building as a relic of the past, we could use design to celebrate its history in a fresh and approachable way, encouraging residents to participate in the consultation process.",
      "CONCEPT_STRATEGY": "Concept and strategy",
      "CONCEPT_STRATEGY_DESCRIPTION": "We determined that the project needed a contemporary identity that felt relevant to a younger audience without losing its historic soul. A monochromatic palette offered simplicity and clear visual impact. The symbol was created using the building’s distinctive silhouette, which we were able to study in detail through drone imagery. Translating its outline into a graphic mark gave the brand a strong sense of place and immediate recognisability. To balance the length of the project name and strengthen the personality of the logo, the letters M, N and A were customised in line with the shape of the symbol. A flexible and eye-catching pattern was also developed to support both print and digital applications, helping the visual identity feel cohesive across all materials.",
      "FINAL_RESULT": "Final result",
      "FINAL_RESULT_DESCRIPTION": "The branding was very positively received by the local community. The visual identity improved recognition of the project across the neighbourhood and helped increase participation in public consultations by 40% compared with previous initiatives. The designed materials sparked positive feedback on social media and local forums, where residents highlighted the emotional link between the graphic proposal and the history of the building. Ultimately, the brand positioned the development as a modern and inclusive initiative that respected collective memory while engaging directly with the residents of Tooting, London."
