    "ABOUT_ME": "Hi! My name is Irene, and I’m a senior graphic designer specialized in branding. Design has always been part of my life: growing up in a print shop surrounded by color swatches, the smell of ink, and stacks of paper… I had no other option. While trying to decode the secrets behind communication effectively through images, I decided to study audiovisuals and photography, and in this path I discovered that graphic design is my passion.\n\nEveryone said “Everything is design”. Discovering the reasons behind an effective and visual interesting design, became my new mission/obsession.",
